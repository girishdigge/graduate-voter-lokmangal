# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Padhvidhar Matdar Sangh project is a comprehensive voter management system designed to streamline voter enrollment and administrative oversight. The system consists of two main interfaces: a public-facing enrollment portal where citizens can register as voters by providing personal information and required documents, and an administrative dashboard for verification and management of voter records. The system handles document uploads, reference management, WhatsApp notifications, and provides robust search and filtering capabilities for administrators.
