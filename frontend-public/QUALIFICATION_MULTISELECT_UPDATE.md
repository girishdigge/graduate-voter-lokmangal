# Qualification Field - Multiselect Implementation

## Overview

Updated the qualification field in the ProfileModal to use a multiselect checkbox system instead of a single dropdown, matching the pattern used in the enrollment form and allowing users to select multiple qualifications.

## Changes Made

### From Single Select to Multiselect

- **Before**: Single dropdown with one qualification selection
- **After**: Multiple checkboxes allowing multiple qualification selections

### Qualification Options (Same as Enrollment Form)

- **Graduate**
- **Post Graduate**
- **Professional Degree**
- **Other**

### Implementation Details

#### UI Changes

- **Checkbox Grid**: 2-column responsive grid layout for qualification options
- **Individual Checkboxes**: Each qualification option has its own checkbox
- **Proper Labels**: Accessible labels linked to checkboxes via `htmlFor` and `id`
- **Visual Consistency**: Matches the disabilities field styling from enrollment form

#### Data Handling

- **Storage Format**: Multiple qualifications stored as comma-separated string
- **Display Format**: Shows selected qualifications as comma-separated list in read mode
- **State Management**: New `handleQualificationChange` function manages checkbox state

#### Functions Added

```typescript
const handleQualificationChange = (value: string, checked: boolean) => {
  const currentQualifications = editData.qualification
    ? editData.qualification.split(',').map(q => q.trim())
    : [];
  if (checked) {
    const newQualifications = [...currentQualifications, value];
    setEditData(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      qualification: newQualifications.join(', '),
    }));
  } else {
    const newQualifications = currentQualifications.filter(q => q !== value);
    setEditData(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      qualification: newQualifications.join(', '),
    }));
  }
};
```

### User Experience Improvements

#### Edit Mode

- Users can select multiple qualifications simultaneously
- Clear visual feedback with checkboxes
- Responsive grid layout for better mobile experience
- Consistent with enrollment form experience

#### Display Mode

- Shows all selected qualifications as readable text
- Graceful handling of empty/null values
- Comma-separated format for multiple selections

### Data Compatibility

- **Backward Compatible**: Existing single qualification data still works
- **Forward Compatible**: Supports multiple qualifications
- **API Compatible**: Sends data as comma-separated string to backend
- **Database Compatible**: Stores as string field, no schema changes needed

### Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Users can have multiple qualifications (Graduate + Professional, etc.)
2. **Consistency**: Matches enrollment form UX patterns
3. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive checkbox interface
4. **Comprehensive**: Better represents real-world qualification scenarios
5. **Accessible**: Proper labeling and keyboard navigation support

## Example Usage

- User with both Graduate and Professional degrees can select both
- User with Post Graduate and Other qualifications can select both
- Single qualification users continue to work as before
- Display shows: "Graduate, Professional Degree" for multiple selections
