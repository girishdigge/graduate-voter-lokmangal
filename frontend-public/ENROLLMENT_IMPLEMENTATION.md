# Enrollment Page Implementation

## Overview

Implemented complete enrollment functionality that submits user data to the backend and redirects to the dashboard for document upload and reference management.

## Changes Made

### 1. EnrollmentPage.tsx

- **API Integration**: Added proper API call to submit enrollment data
- **Data Transformation**: Transform form data to match backend API structure
- **Authentication**: Store user token and data after successful enrollment
- **Navigation**: Redirect to dashboard after successful submission
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading State**: Show loading state during submission

### 2. AuthContext Updates

- **New Method**: Added `loginWithUserData()` method for direct login with user data and token
- **Type Safety**: Updated AuthContextType interface to include new method

## Data Flow

### Form Submission Process

1. User completes enrollment form
2. Form data is validated using Zod schema
3. Data is transformed to match backend API structure
4. API call is made to `/api/users/enroll`
5. On success:
   - User token is stored in localStorage
   - User data is stored in localStorage
   - Auth context is updated
   - User is redirected to dashboard
6. On error:
   - Error message is displayed to user
   - Form remains accessible for retry

### Data Transformation

The form data is transformed from the nested structure to flat structure expected by backend:

```typescript
// Form Structure (nested)
{
  personalInfo: { fullName, sex, ... },
  address: { houseNumber, street, ... },
  elector: { isRegisteredElector, ... },
  education: { university, ... }
}

// API Structure (flat)
{
  fullName, sex, houseNumber, street,
  isRegisteredElector, university, ...
}
```

## Next Steps After Enrollment

After successful enrollment, users are redirected to the dashboard where they can:

1. **Upload Documents**:
   - Aadhar Card
   - Passport Photo
   - Degree Certificate
   - Other required documents

2. **Add References**:
   - Contact information for people who can vouch for the application
   - WhatsApp notifications sent to references

3. **Track Status**:
   - View verification status
   - See admin feedback
   - Monitor application progress

## API Endpoints Used

- `POST /api/users/enroll` - Submit enrollment data
- Returns: `{ success: true, data: { user, token } }`

## Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Generic retry message
- **Validation Errors**: Specific field-level errors from backend
- **Server Errors**: User-friendly error messages
- **Authentication**: Automatic token storage and context update

## Security Features

- **Token Storage**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- **Data Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **Error Sanitization**: Sensitive data not exposed in error messages

## User Experience

- **Progress Indicator**: Multi-step form with clear progress
- **Validation**: Real-time form validation
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during submission
- **Success Flow**: Automatic redirect to next step
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with retry options

## Bug Fixes Applied (Latest Update)

### Data Type Issues Fixed:

1. **Field Name Mapping**: `graduationDocumentType` â†’ `graduationDocType`
2. **Number Conversion**: `graduationYear` converted from string to number
3. **Array Handling**: `disabilities` always sent as array (empty array if no disabilities)
4. **Undefined Values**: Changed undefined values to empty strings for optional fields
5. **Aadhar Number**: Properly included from navigation state

### Validation Issues Resolved:

- **Optional Fields**: Ensured optional string fields send empty strings instead of undefined
- **Array Fields**: Ensured disabilities field is always an array
- **Required Fields**: All required fields properly mapped and validated

### Error Handling Improvements:

- **Validation Errors**: Display specific field-level validation errors from backend
- **Server Errors**: Handle 400 and 500 errors appropriately
- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling of network connectivity issues

## Testing Notes

The enrollment should now work correctly with proper data transformation and validation. Users can:

1. Enter Aadhar number on landing page
2. Fill out enrollment form with all sections
3. Submit successfully and get redirected to dashboard
4. Upload documents and add references from dashboard
